# booking
Simply add the files to the plugin folder inside wp-content.

Alter the connections.php to fit your data base needs, and upload the sql file to your database with all the correct table details.

Will work on all themes but custom themes need to have a singular.php file to display the calendar for the booking function, there is a basic example of what is required to set up the calendar, (add to \themes\(Custom theme folder)).

There is also a Android app to that is fully integrated with the api that both syncs and add entries to the grid and has a similar layout as this calendar for further queries email me at aneurin@aneurinj.com
